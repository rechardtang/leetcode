/**
 * Given a cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][],
 * write a function that returns cost of minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0).
 * Each cell of the matrix represents a cost to traverse through that cell.
 * The total cost of a path to reach (m, n) is the sum of all the costs on that path (including both source and destination).
 * You can only traverse down, right and diagonally lower cells from a given cell, i.e.,
 * from a given cell (i, j), cells (i+1, j), (i, j+1), and (i+1, j+1) can be traversed.
 * You may assume that all costs are positive integers.
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * 1, 2, 3
 * 4, 8, 2
 * 1, 5, 3
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * 8
